(work in progress)

This project aims to simulate a trading program that allows users to trade within the btc-usd pair. 

In order to run it first you need to run the command npm install on both the front end and back end, then you while you have docker engine running you run the command npm run sql on the back end. After that you can replace the .env.example file with a .env file of your choosing, then you can run npm run dev on both the back end and front end and you can then use the program normally.
